====================
NO LONGER MAINTAINED
====================

My interest in Vagrant and thus this code waned some time ago. Fortunately the
wonderful `brbsix <https://github.com/brbsix/vagrant-bash-completion>`_ and I
fully endorse this.

Installation
============

Debian/Ubuntu
-------------

.. code:: bash

    sudo wget https://raw.github.com/kura/vagrant-bash-completion/master/etc/bash_completion.d/vagrant -O /etc/bash_completion.d/vagrant


OS X
----

@kura is now supporting releases to homebrew-completions because
other people stopped doing it.

*Please note: @kura is not a Mac user, all Mac & Homebrew support
was provided by additional contributors. I will help as much as I
can but I can't promise anything. Sorry.*

With `homebrew <http://brew.sh/>`_ you can install the
`vagrant-completion` recipe to use this plugin

.. code:: bash

    brew tap homebrew/completions
    brew install vagrant-completion

then add the following lines to your ~/.bashrc

.. code:: bash

    if [ -f `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/vagrant ]; then
	source `brew --prefix`/etc/bash_completion.d/vagrant
    fi
